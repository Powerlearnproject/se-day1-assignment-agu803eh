Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that is used for developing, designing, building, maintaining and testing software. It is an important aspect of technological advancement as it offers the simple product solutions to tasking problems. It involves designing and developing a simple product tailored to the needs of the end users while also provide great user experience. This ranges from computer games, mobile and PC applications, Operating systems etc. It offers reliability, security, scalability and efficiency. This ensures that tasks are run smoothly, processesed faster, secured end to end with great risk control and mitigation process in place and well as ensuring that the system can handle heavy loads and traffic amidst vast number of users while retaining its efficiiency. 



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-The emergence of high-level programming languages like Fortran and COBOL
-The development of object-oriented programming (OOP)
-The rise of cloud computing


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Planning -  This is the stage where the purpose and scope of the project is being defined. It involves mapping out the basic requirements, what the target audience/market is, what problem the software is designed to offer solutions to, the feasibility of the project. 
Requirement analysis - This stage identifies the final user specification and ensures that the project is both usable by the end users and meets their requirements. 
Design - This is the stage where the project is being designed, built, developed. 
Coding - This entails converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - This involves tetsing the software for quality assurannce, examining it for bugs and glitches to ensure it's available for optimal use 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

While the waterfall metholodolgy is rigid, Agile is quite flexible. The agile methodology allows for testing at every iteration stage whereas waterfall only allows for testing twoards the end of the development process. While customers' feedbacks are being incorporated during the deisgn process for the agile methodology and allows for improvement real time, waterfall methodology implies that feedbacks are given at a later stage of the process where it has less effect on the product improvement and as such, makes it diffcult for changes to made to the system. 

Example of Agile methodology: Agile in Software Development for Startups as this allows for intermittent incoproration of customers' feedback and testing at every point of the product development. 

Example of waterfall methodology implementation: 





Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
